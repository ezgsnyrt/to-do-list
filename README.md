# To-Do List Application

This project is a **React.js-based To-Do List application** that allows users to efficiently create, update, and manage their tasks. It is designed to be **simple**, **intuitive**, and **responsive**, making it an ideal solution for task management.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks by providing a name, description, priority level (High, Medium, Low), and due date using the form. Completing all the input fields is a requirement for the new task to be created via form.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks, including updating their names or details by clicking on the pencil icon at the right side of each task item.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed by clicking on trash bin icon.
- **Task Status Management**: Mark tasks as `Pending` or `Completed` and move tasks between these statuses.
- **Priority Sorting**: Automatically sort tasks based on their priority (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`). This means that when users create a new task with high priority it is displayed through the top of the task list.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## Note

This project is a **frontend-only application** and works independently from the `server` folder present in the repository.

The `server` folder exists because the backend for this project was developed separately as part of a MERN stack implementation. A related **Medium post** explaining the backend project has already been published. In the upcoming days, the `main` branch will contain the full MERN stack version of this project.
